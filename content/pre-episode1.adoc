== Oh Look! Another Tech Podcast!

Well. Sorta'. Maybe. link:https://twitter.com/dsirrine[Dave Sirrine] and link:https://twitter.com/jamieeduncan[me] have a combined 3204043 years of experience in IT. Approximately. We might have rounded up a bit. But it's a lot.

We are also luckily and uniquely positioned to talk to a huge swatch of the Open Source Technology Community.

So our plans are to bring them and their technologies on to this podcast and have a good time.

The plan is for this project to be a nuts and bolts sort of thing. There will be lots of demos and howtos and talking about the solving of problems. We will keep the debating of theory to a practical minimum. We hope.

Unless we get an awesome sponsor. Then it's all theory all the time.

Or not.

== Dad, Husband, Linux Geek, F1 Fan, Farm Owner

But not always in that order. I like to think of myself as a problem solver in everything that I do.

I apply that idea to Linux and Open Source software for my day job.

I apply it to the 6 acres of land we own every chance I get.

I apply it to being a good man at all times for my wife Molly and daughter Elizabeth.

And I like to watch a lot of F1 Racing.

And the Washington Redskins
